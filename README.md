# Wandering in the Woods Game

## Introduction

This repository contains the Source Code, Executables, Documentation (Design Document and User's Guide) along with how to execute the Game: ***Wandering in the Woods***. This project is developed as part of the course: **Software Engineering** taught by **Dr. Fadi Wedyan**.

## About the Game

Wandering in the Woods is an educational computing game for kids in grades K-5 that teaches them the basics of computation and computational thinking by playing a video game. The K-2 and 3-5 levels get progressively more difficult.

**K-2 Level:** The grid is square, and the players start at opposite corners of the principal diagonal. They move randomly until they meet one another.

**3-5 Level:** Rectangular grid with the user providing the Dimensions of the grid, and the number of players along with the coordinates of the starting position of each player. The maximum allowed player limit is 4. Players wander randomly till they meet, and when they meet the statistics are displayed to the User.

Itâ€™s a modular game, with separate classes for each level, a simple user interface and built-in audio prompts to reinforce learning.

## Steps to Install and Run the Game

- Download the 'executables.zip' Archive which contains 2 files:
  - `game_launcher.exe`: Executable file which contains the code to run the program. All the python libraries and modules that are required to run the program are bundled into this single executable file.
  - `happy-and-joyful-children.wav`: Music file that contains children music to be used for K-2 Grades when playing the game. Without this file, one cannot run the game for K-2 grades.
- Once the executables.zip Archive is download, extract the content into a single folder. (**Note:** Remember both the files need to be present together in the same folder)
- Once the contents of the Archive are extracted into a folder, open that folder and run / open the `game_launcher.exe` file.
- If any Anti-Virus Software like Windows Defender pops up and warns you about launching this game, ignore it and run the program any way, the file contains no harmful content that affects your device.
